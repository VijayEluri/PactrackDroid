PactrackDroid
======

This is an updated version of PactrackDroid that was developed by Joakim Andersson
and then abandoned at the end of 2011.

I have mainly updated the UI and adapted it to use the Action Bar and Holo UI.
There is still work to be done but it's a bit closer.

Installation
------------

1. Download PactrackDroid from git: `$ git clone git://github.com/blunden/PactrackDroid.git`
2. Build in Eclipse (or add configuration to build with ANT)
3. Sign with your own key (the debug key only works in the emulator) 
4. Install on your device (Unknown sources must be enabled in Settings)
