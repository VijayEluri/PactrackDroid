PactrackDroid
======

This is PactrackDroid, an Android application to keep track of parcels sent with
the Swedish mail service (Swedish language only).
Originally developed by Joakim Andersson, but abandoned in 2011. blunden made
updates to the design of the app to fit Android 4.0+ in 2013, after which the
project was un-abandoned.

-------

PactrackDroid was created and is maintained by Joakim Andersson.
The user interface, as it looks today, was made by blunden. The project would
still be abandoned if it wasn't for that awesome new look. :)
